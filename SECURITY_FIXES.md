# Security Fixes Applied

This document outlines the critical security vulnerabilities that have been fixed in your pregnancy tracker application.

## Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection
**Issue**: Missing CSRF protection on state-changing endpoints
**Fix**: 
- Added CSRF tokens for critical endpoints (`/api/profile`, `/api/daily-report`, `/api/delete-account`)
- Configured secure cookie settings with `httpOnly`, `secure`, and `sameSite` attributes

### 2. Log Injection Prevention
**Issue**: User input was logged without sanitization, allowing log manipulation
**Fix**: 
- All user inputs are now sanitized using `encodeURIComponent()` before logging
- Applied to server.js, DailyReport.js, and Journal.js

### 3. NoSQL Injection Protection
**Issue**: Direct user input in MongoDB queries could allow database manipulation
**Fix**: 
- Email queries now use regex with escaped special characters
- Prevents malicious query injection through email fields

### 4. Code Injection Prevention
**Issue**: Unsanitized input in PDF generation and canvas operations
**Fix**: 
- All user data is sanitized before being used in jsPDF operations
- Canvas operations now handle data securely

### 5. Hardcoded Credentials Removal
**Issue**: Example API keys were exposed in documentation
**Fix**: 
- Removed hardcoded API key examples
- Created secure `.env.example` template
- Updated documentation to use placeholder values

### 6. Package Vulnerabilities
**Issue**: Vulnerable dependencies detected in package-lock.json
**Recommendation**: 
- Run `npm audit fix` to update vulnerable packages
- Update PostCSS to version 8.4.32 or higher
- Update serialize-javascript to version 6.0.2 or higher

## Additional Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Enhanced CORS Configuration
- Restricted origins based on environment
- Enabled credentials for secure cookie handling

### 2. Input Validation
- Added file size limits for image uploads (1MB max)
- Image compression to prevent large file attacks

### 3. Error Handling
- Sanitized error messages to prevent information disclosure
- Generic error responses to avoid exposing system details

### 4. Environment Security
- Created secure environment template
- Removed sensitive data from version control

## Recommendations for Production

### 1. Environment Variables
- Use strong, unique JWT secrets (minimum 32 characters)
- Use secure MongoDB connection strings with authentication
- Enable HTTPS in production

### 2. Rate Limiting
- Current rate limits are in place (100 requests/15min general, 5 requests/15min auth)
- Consider implementing user-specific rate limiting

### 3. Database Security
- Enable MongoDB authentication
- Use connection string with credentials
- Implement database-level access controls

### 4. HTTPS Configuration
- Enable HTTPS in production
- Update CORS origins to use HTTPS URLs
- Set secure cookie flags

### 5. Regular Security Updates
- Run `npm audit` regularly
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor for new security advisories

## Testing Security Fixes

### 1. CSRF Protection Test
```bash
# This should fail without proper CSRF token
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test"}'
```

### 2. Log Injection Test
- Try submitting forms with special characters like `\n`, `\r`, `\t`
- Verify logs don't contain unescaped user input

### 3. NoSQL Injection Test
- Try logging in with email: `{"$ne": null}`
- Should fail with proper input validation

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Log Monitoring
- Monitor application logs for suspicious patterns
- Set up alerts for repeated failed authentication attempts

### 2. Dependency Updates
- Schedule regular dependency updates
- Use tools like Dependabot for automated security updates

### 3. Security Scanning
- Run security scans before deployment
- Use tools like npm audit, Snyk, or similar
